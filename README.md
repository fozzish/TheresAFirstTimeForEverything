You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important info about your project. A README, a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines and a code of conduct communicate expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.
A README is often the first item visitors will see when visiting your repository. RAEDME files typically include information on the following:
-What the project does
-Why the project is useful
-How users can get started with the project
-Where users can get help with your projects
-Who maintains and contributes to the project
When writing README files, we use Markdown, a markup language for creating formatted text in a text editor.
